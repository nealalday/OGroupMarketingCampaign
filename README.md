## Project Background
This project analyses CRM campaign performance data from **O Group, an iGaming software company.** The focus is on evaluating email and SMS campaigns sent to two key customer segments: **Non Depositors** (users who registered but haven’t deposited) and **New Depositors** (users who have made their first deposit). These campaigns aim to **maximise player conversion and engagement while minimising opt-outs**. By exploring key metrics such as delivery, open, click, and unsubscribe rates, this report identifies what’s working, what needs improvement, and offers data-driven recommendations to **optimise future campaign performance.**

## Executive Summary
**Welcome Email campaigns** showed strong delivery (84.5%) and moderate open rates (43.8%), while below average click rates (13.6%) strongly necessitate room to improve subject lines and timing. Unsubscribes were low (1.2%), suggesting that users are open to receiving onboarding communications but are not properly engaging with the content.

**New Depositor campaigns performed well**, with high delivery (96.2%) and click rates (77.7%), but also a higher unsubscribe rate (4.8%), possibly due to messaging fatigue. SMS-only campaigns lacked open rate tracking, impacting measurement and visibility. 

A/B testing of the New Depositors - Day 3 campaigns showed **Version A drove more engagement but had higher unsubscribes**, while Version B retained users better but saw less interaction. **A blended strategy is recommended** to combine the best components of both into a singular, stronger strategy.

To improve performance, **focus on Day 1 and Day 3 campaigns**, ensuring users are retained early on and to drive their first deposit. Targeted personalisation techniques, reevaluating SMS send times and frequency, and refining message content while balancing promotional and informational content are all recommended. **Continued segmentation and testing will be key to refining CRM effectiveness.**

## Insights and Recommendations 
![Easygo_Pack2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18442101-bf3b-4566-91e1-3c28058342fc)
- **Less than half of users open the welcome campaign with low unsubscriptions (1.2%),**  indicating users are not engaging enough.
- **Recommendations:** Drive stronger first impressions and encourage early user conversion by:
  - Optimising subject lines and send times to boost open rate (43.8%)
  - Adding follow-up emails to re-engage non-openers
  - Strengthening the call-to-action and enhancing content and design, including personalised next steps (e.g., “Complete your first deposit”) and welcome incentives like bonus offers

- Account Registration Day 3, Day 14 campaigns (SMS) have a **below average delivery rate** (47.3% and 52.5%), indicating invalid numbers or messages blocked due to spam filters and/or carrier restrictions.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **SMS Troubleshooting:** Check bounce rates, SMS error codes, delivery rates by country (if campaign is international)
  - **Data collection:** Validate phone number formats at signup, clean invalid entries regularly, and ensure correct country codes.
  - **Spam filtering:** Optimise message content to remove trigger words, URL shorteners Consider multi-channel approach for maximum delivery and better tracking

![Easygo_Pack11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2836162-f2cd-4159-86db-8796da95e381)
- **Non-depositors start unsubscribing by Day 3,** peaking at Day 14.
- **Recommendation: Focus on Days 1 and 3 of lifecycle.**
  - **Day 1:** Sustain immediate interest with welcome offers, deposit match offers during peak play hours, personalisation, psychological strategies (player socialisation, sense of belonging)
  - **Day 3:** Offer stronger incentives, time-sensitive offers, reinforce loyalty by highlighting “exclusivity”

![Easygo_Pack12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ae1a10-2b04-4a0e-b938-e2b57dd06fdb)
- **New Depositors campaigns perform well overall,** with high delivery rates (96.2%), open rate (48.1%) and click rate (77.7%).
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Continue campaign execution** strategies while identifying what drives engagement.
  - Ensure emails get **delivered to the right inbox** to maximise deliverability.
  - Given the strong click rate, consider integrating **cross-sell or upsell opportunities** within the campaign.

- **Version A outperforms Version B in open and click rates, while also having a higher unsubscribe rate.** This suggests that while Version A’s messaging is more engaging, New Depositors might not like the linked content, leading to opt-outs.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Apply Version A’s effective hooks** with Version B’s content
  - **Identify potential pain points** (e.g., overly aggressive offers, irrelevant content) and refine targeting or segmentation accordingly.

- **SMS campaigns have a higher unsubscribe rate,** while New Depositors unsubscribe more than Non-Depositors.
- **Recommendations:** To keep New Depositors subscribed,
  - Pattern marketing materials based on **player interest** (casino, live, sport, etc.)
  - Optimise communication frequency to **prevent overload.**
  - To reduce SMS opt-outs, **personalise messages based on player behavior** (e.g., free spins for inactive users, cashback for active bettors).

For further analysis, **I pose the following questions if given more data:**
- Does unsubscribing from campaigns correlate with overall engagement on the platform (e.g., fewer deposits, fewer sessions)?
- Are users who unsubscribe more likely to show patterns of inactivity prior to unsubscribing? Can we identify any warning signals that suggest a user is likely to unsubscribe soon?
- How does the tone of the message (e.g., urgency, casual, formal) impact unsubscribe behaviour?
  
A cohort analysis can be conducted to track the behaviour of Non-Depositors understand at which point they are most likely to deposit or unsubscribe. Additionally, churn rates can be monitored to identify what factors (e.g., decreased deposits, fewer game plays) contribute to player retention.
